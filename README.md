# LEGATO: Listening Enhanced Graphical Audio Transcription Output

## Main Goal

Transcription of audio recordings of pianoforte or orchestral performances into musical scores accurately.
This addresses several challenges faced by musicians, composers, and music enthusiasts:
1. Transcription Accuracy:
   Many musicians and composers need accurate transcriptions of audio performances
   to study, analyze, or learn from.
   Manual transcription can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
2. Accessibility:
   Converting audio recordings into readable musical notation makes the music accessible to a wider audience
3. Education and Learning:
   Students and learners can benefit from having access to accurate transcriptions of musical performances
   to aid in their practice and understanding of music theory and composition.

## The road to the target

The application will utilize advanced audio processing and machine learning techniques.
Here's how it will supposedly work:
1. Audio Analysis: The application will take audio recordings of pianoforte or orchestral
   performances as input. It will analyze the audio signals to identify individual notes
   played by different instruments, considering factors such as pitch, duration, and dynamics.
2. Instrument Separation: Using signal processing algorithms and machine learning models,
   the application will separate the audio signals into streams corresponding to different
   instruments in the performance.
3. Note Transcription: Once the audio signals are separated by instrument, the application
   will transcribe the notes played by each instrument into a digital musical score.
   This process involves converting the audio information into symbolic notation, including pitch,
   rhythm, tempo, and dynamics.
4. Score Generation: Finally, the application will generate a visually readable musical score
   for each instrument, accurately representing the performance captured in the audio recording.
